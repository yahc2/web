* Interlisp, Maiko & Medley
  [[file:images/Interlisp-D.png]]
  This page is dedicated to the exploration of Interlisp in its modern
  flavor. A couple of years ago [[https://larrymasinter.net/][Larry Masinter]], one of the original
  developers of Xerox Interlisp, rekindled his interest in (or maybe
  never really lost it) bringing the old Maiko/Medley emulation code
  up to shape and making it generally usable. This began with a
  [[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/interlisp/jq0dJQEWDkU][mailing list]] and culminated with the creation of a [[https://github.com/Interlisp][GitHub
  organization]]. Nowadays, the most complete source of knowledge seems
  to be the [[https://github.com/interlisp/medley/wiki][Interlisp Wiki]] hosted on GitHub.
** Installation
   As of today, the Medley Interlisp environment consists of two
   components:
   - [[https://github.com/interlisp/maiko][Maiko]] - low-level implementation of the Medley Interlisp virtual
     machine, written mostly in C.
   - [[https://github.com/Interlisp/medley][Medley]] - the actual Interlisp environment, written primarily in
     Common Lisp
*** Installing Maiko
    Maiko requires =make=, =clang= and X11 development libraries,
    which translates to the following in a typical Debian derivative:
    #+begin_src bash
      $ sudo apt install clang make libx11-dev
    #+end_src
    First, clone the repo:
    #+begin_src bash
      $ git clone https://github.com/Interlisp/maiko
    #+end_src
    Next, enter =maiko/bin= and build the project:
    #+begin_src bash
      $ cd maiko/bin
      $ ./makeright x
    #+end_src
    You should now have two binaries, =lde= and =ldex= in the
    =maiko/<ostype>.<cputype>= directory
    (e.g. =linux.x86_64=). Instructions for building in other
    environments can be found in the repo.
*** Installing Medley
    Clone the repo:
    #+begin_src bash
      $ git clone https://github.com/Interlisp/medley
    #+end_src
    Then enter the =medley= directory and run:
    #+begin_src bash
      $ ./run-medley
    #+end_src
    This will assume certain defaults regarding screen size, location
    of the Maiko binaries, etc. The script's source lists various CLI
    options that it recognizes. One of immediate use is
    =--dimensions==, which lets you specify the screen size for
    Medley.
