* Python - trying to appreciate the good bits
Having arrived at another point when I'm about to start a new job and
it being a largely Python job, I decided to try and compile a list of
resources, hacks and observations that make Python decent and
worthwhile. For a long time it's been the subject of my Lisp-centric
bitching about the inadequacy of everything non-Lisp. It can be an
alluring pose to adopt, similar to how some people find it
existentially sooting to become professional victims. Don't get me
wrong, I probably still think the Lisp family of languages is the
bee's knees and I enjoy very much using CL as my goto language, but
I've noticed the lispiness (of a job, library or project) have in the
past tended to cloud my judgement and override other parts of the
picture. To the extend I was willing to contemplate an objectively
inferior position just to be able to hack Lisp.

Trying to concentrate on the bits I find thought-provoking, gratifying
or just plain fun is my attempt to exorcise out the creeping
proclivity for cynicism that I've seen develop in too many a colleague
at various workplaces. You probably know the rhetoric - today's
technologies are inferior, we're way past the prime of our technical
culture, the world is going to hell and dragging us with it. True?
Maybe to some extent. Depressing? Definitely. Not that we should be
willfully blind to negative tendencies around us - on the
contrary. But my optimism needs fuel and I've been running on empty
for too long, hence this attempt at fueling it. It can be fun to adopt
a certain smugness and view the entire technological landscape through
a lens concisely embodied by the following image:

my appreciation and sympathy for Python and maybe bring it a little
closer to how I see Lisp in my head.
