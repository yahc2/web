* Hacking Culture & Hacking Spirit
  The idea behind this section is to collect various resources -
  digital or otherwise - expounding the frenetic and restless spirit
  of hacking pursuits. Ideally, all items here should posess "the
  quality without a name" so that even if they're not explicitly about
  hacking, they succeed at evoking a certain frame of mind...

** Books
**** [[https://www.amazon.com/What-Dormouse-Said-Counterculture-Personal/dp/0143036769][John Markoff - What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry]]
     A very West Coast, countercultural account of the development of
     computing and its percolation to the people. Gives a lot of
     background on how many of the pioneers had goals far grander than
     technical breakthroughs, focusing rather on augmenting the human
     condition.

**** [[https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Computer-Revolution-Steven-Levy/dp/1449388396][Steven Levy - Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]]
     The canonical history of the hacker community. Divided into three
     parts dealing with the MIT hackers (60s mostly), West Coast
     hardware hackers (70s) and game hackers (80s). Perhaps too
     exalted at times, but still fun to read.
** Games
**** [[http://www.zachtronics.com/eliza/][Eliza]]
     More a visual novel than game. Centers around Evelyn, who used to
     work on therapeutic applications of AI for a large company. After
     a three-year break from her previous life she reemerges and tries
     to get a grip of her life again. Visually beautiful and
     meditative.
**** [[http://www.zachtronics.com/exapunks/][Exapunks]]
     A hacking game set in the alternative 90s (what with the gray and
     red WinAmp-y interfaces). Provides an interesting and moody
     backstory of Moss, a former hacker/cracker battling with a
     neuro-degenerative disease known as /the phage/. Gameplay
     involves programming EXAs - tiny processes visualized as robots -
     in a simple machine language. 
**** [[http://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/][Shenzhen I/O]]
     An electronics/assembly hacking game. An American expat in

** Articles
**** [[https://wiki.matthew.nz/view/zenclavier][Zenclavier]]
     Musings on how interfaces get in the way of actually manipulating
     ideas. Taking Vim as the prime example of minimizing overhead,
     the author ponders the importance of getting "zenned out" easily.
