* Hacking Culture & Hacking Spirit
  The idea behind this section is to collect various resources -
  digital or otherwise - expounding the frenetic and restless spirit
  of hacking pursuits. Ideally, all items here should posess "the
  quality without a name" so that even if they're not explicitly about
  hacking, they succeed at evoking a certain frame of mind...

** Books
**** [[https://www.amazon.com/What-Dormouse-Said-Counterculture-Personal/dp/0143036769][John Markoff - What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry]]
     A very West Coast, countercultural account of the development of
     computing and its percolation to the people. Gives a lot of
     background on how many of the pioneers had goals far grander than
     technical breakthroughs, focusing rather on augmenting the human
     condition.

***** [[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721001434/http://www.peaceworkmagazine.org/pwork/0508/050814.htm][Edward Hasbrouck's review of the book]]
**** [[https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Computer-Revolution-Steven-Levy/dp/1449388396][Steven Levy - Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]]
     The canonical history of the hacker community. Divided into three
     parts dealing with the MIT hackers (60s mostly), West Coast
     hardware hackers (70s) and game hackers (80s). Perhaps too
     exalted at times, but still fun to read.
** Games
**** [[http://www.zachtronics.com/eliza/][Eliza]]
     More a visual novel than game. Centers around Evelyn, who used to
     work on therapeutic applications of AI for a large company. After
     a three-year break from her previous life she reemerges and tries
     to get a grip of her life again. Visually beautiful and
     meditative.
**** [[http://www.zachtronics.com/exapunks/][Exapunks]]
     A hacking game set in the alternative 90s (what with the gray and
     red WinAmp-y interfaces). Provides an interesting and moody
     backstory of Moss, a former hacker/cracker battling with a
     neuro-degenerative disease known as /the phage/. Gameplay
     involves programming EXAs - tiny processes visualized as robots -
     in a simple machine language. 
**** [[http://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/][Shenzhen I/O]]
     An electronics/assembly hacking game. An American expat in
     Shenzhen, China goes to work for Longteng Ltd. - an electronics
     company. The challenges consist of both hardware and software
     design. The programming model is a simple assembly language.
**** Dunnet
     Text adventure written by Ron Schnell. Part of every instance of
     GNU/Emacs since forever. =M-x dunnet=. Interesting plot twist
     unfolds when...
**** [[https://hadeanlands.com/][Hadean Lands]]
     Text adventure from IF legend Andrew Plotkin. An apprentice
     alchemist needs to survive after his alchemically-powered
     spaceship crashes on an alien planet. Paracelsus meets "Monday
     Starts on Saturday", meets Count Cagliostro, meets...
**** [[https://www.funghisoft.com/mhrd][MHRD]]
     Digital circuit design simulator. You're employed by a fictional
     company by the name of... Microhard. Your objective is to build
     steadily more complicated logical components using a very simple
     and intuitive hardware description language. Your efforts
     culminate in a design for a complete (albeit simple) CPU.
** Videos
*** Interviews
**** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhOHn9TClXY][Joe Armstrong Interviews Alan Kay]]
     A fascinating interview that Rai recommended to me a while
     ago. Joe behaves like a moderate case of ADHD, interrupting Alan
     more than necessary, but still... This interview mentions two
     metric shitloads of fascinating papers and projects that have
     mostly been forgotten.
** Articles
**** [[https://wiki.matthew.nz/view/zenclavier][Zenclavier]]
     Musings on how interfaces get in the way of actually manipulating
     ideas. Taking Vim as the prime example of minimizing overhead,
     the author ponders the importance of getting "zenned out" easily.
** Websites
**** [[https://lainzine.org/][Lainzine]]
     Zine associated with [[https://lainchan.org/][Lainchan]]. All kinds of articles on
     programming, security, cryptography, cognition, art, politics,
     etc.
** Operating Systems
*** Unix
    Unix, the archetypal hacker's choice. Love it or hate it. The
    UNiplexed Information and Computing Service is here to stay.
**** [[http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/][The Art Of Unix Programming]]
     A book-sized overview of the Unix philosophy by Eric
     S. Raymond. This book will probably not teach you systems
     programming under Unix. Rather, it will serve as a systematic
     exposition of the decades-long accumulation of practices, design
     principles and historical accidents.
***** [[http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch02s01.html][Origins and History of Unix, 1969-1995]]
      Fairly detailed history of how Unix came to be. Entertaining and
      informative. Good companion to Peter Salus' book.
***** [[http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/hackers.html][Origins and History of the Hackers, 1961-1995]]
      History and folklore of the hacker community and how at some
      point it merged with the Unix folks.
**** [[https://web.archive.org/web/20200731175107/http://www.groklaw.net/staticpages/index.php?page=20051013231901859][The Daemon, the GNU & the Penguin]]
     An in-depth history of Unix, GNU and Linux. Lots of tidbits,
     anecdotes and pointers to other resources.
**** [[https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/dmr.pdf][Doug McIlroy's appreciation of Dennis Ritchie]]
**** [[https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/cacm.pdf][Ken & Dennis' Unix paper from CACM '74]]
**** [[https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/][Dennis Ritchie's homepage - a treasure trove]]
**** [[http://www.ruddcanaday.com/adventures/][Rudd Canaday - My Adventures in Software]]
     A memoir of Rudd Canaday - one of the lesser known early
     contributors to Unix development. Canaday is claimed to be
     greatly underappreciated in the history of Unix.
*** Incompatible Timesharing System
    The sound of a tree falling when there's nobody there to hear
    it. An ancient operating system designed and put together by the
    MIT hackers. Originated on the PDP-6, later transplanted to
    PDP-10. Birthplace of MacLisp, Scheme, Planner, Conniver, Emacs
    and many more. Featured extensively in [[*[[https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Computer-Revolution-Steven-Levy/dp/1449388396\][Steven Levy - Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]\]][Levy's book]]. Today it is
    but a memory. Or is it?
**** [[https://its.victor.se/wiki/][ITS Wiki]]
     Bj√∂rn Victor's wiki about the system. Contains both historical
     documents and more contemporary howtos aimed at emulated
     instances. Closely related to the [[http://up.update.uu.se/][UPDATE]] system running in
     Uppsala.
**** [[https://hack.org/mc/blog/its.html][MC's journal entry on ITS]]
     Another Swede, another ITS aficionado. But seriously, MC (Michael
     Cardell Wiederkrantz) is very passionate about retrocomputing and
     this entry is far from being the only one.
**** [[https://its.svensson.org/][Paul Svensson's ITS Page]]
     What is it with Swedish ancestry and ITS? Unfortunately, this
     page is currently unavailable.
**** [[https://github.com/PDP-10][PDP-10 organization on GitHub]]
     One place to rule them all. Largely focused on ITS, but an
     occasional mention of TOPS-20 is not punished by death.
** Retrocomputing
*** Emulation
**** [[https://jamesfriend.com.au/pce-js/][Mac OS System 7]]
     An in-browser Mac emulator. Version 7.0.1
**** [[https://lively-web.org/users/bert/Smalltalk-78.html][Smalltalk-78 in Lively]]
     Smalltalk-78 implementation in Lively, running on WebAssembly (?).
**** [[https://archive.org/details/canoncat][In-browser emulator of Canon Cat]]
     Jef Raskin's original personal computer, now in your browser.
